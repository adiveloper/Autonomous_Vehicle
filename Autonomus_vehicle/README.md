# Self driving car Simulation with Udacity Simulator

### This is a self-driving car simulation built with Udacity open source simulator. 
### This is simulated using Nvidia model. 

### To train you model use: Self_Driving_Car.ipynb

### Use drive.py to run your vehicle in Autonomous Mode after Training is complete.

### If you dont have a good GPU you can train in Google Colab or use model.h5 file directly.

### The file Self_Driving_Car.ipynb contains detailed instruction and work Flow. Go through it; its self explanatory file


### The video of the testing in the autonomous mode can be found at : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db5RR50Oi-Q
